# MAMA: Breast Cancer Challenges 🌸

Welcome to the MAMA Challenges! We are dedicated to advancing breast cancer research through open-source code, high-quality datasets, and reproducible AI benchmarks. 🚀

## 🏆 Highlight: The MAMA-MIA Challenge @ MICCAI 2025 📢

We are proud to showcase the MAMA-MIA Challenge, originally featured at MICCAI 2025! This challenge focuses on large-scale multicenter breast cancer DCE-MRI analysis.

### Challenge Features:

📉 The Dataset: 1,506 cases of breast cancer DCE-MRI with expert segmentations.

🔬 Two Tasks: Automated tumor segmentation and treatment response prediction.

🏆 Evaluation: Validated on private multicenter datasets to ensure real-world robustness.

## 🆕 Upcoming Challenge: MAMA-SYNTH 🧪
Virtual Contrast-Enhanced Breast MRI Synthesis

We are thrilled to announce MAMA-SYNTH, a challenge dedicated to the future of contrast-free breast imaging.

###🌟 Why MAMA-SYNTH?
🚫 Safer Imaging: Reducing reliance on gadolinium-based agents to eliminate safety concerns and contraindications.

📉 Streamlined Workflow: Lowering clinical costs and patient burden through virtual enhancement.

🤖 Generative Excellence: Utilizing SOTA deep generative modeling to synthesize post-contrast images from pre-contrast acquisitions.

### 🎯 Challenge Focus:
🖼️ Image Fidelity: Can synthetic images match the quality of real DCE-MRI?

🔍 Lesion Realism: Ensuring clinically accurate representation of tumors without real contrast.

🏥 Downstream Utility: Validating synthetic data for actual clinical decision-making and treatment monitoring.

🚀 Status: Coming Soon! Stay tuned to this organization for the official dataset release and submission guidelines.
